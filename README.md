## About the Project 
This project investigates different machine learning models for 
the use of predicting credit delinquency of an individual financial metrics. A Credit score  
is a score that is assigned to a borrower based upon many factors including their credit 
utilization ratio, their on-time payment history, and the number of delinquent 
loans they have had. The purpose of a credit score is to give lenders an idea of how 
risky a particular borrower may be to loan to. A higher score indicates that a borrower 
is less risky to loan money to and a lower score indicates that a borrower is 
much risky to loan money to. Models predicting how likely a given borrower 
is to experience credit delinquency in the near future has clear applications and 
uses for credit scoring models. If someone is predicted to be more likely to experience 
serious delinquency then they should receive a lower credit score as compared to someone 
that is less likely to experience serious delinquency. 

The goal of this project, therefore, is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting 
whether a given borrower is likely to experience serious delinquency in the near future.
